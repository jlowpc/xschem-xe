 <h1> TUTORIAL: Manage XSCHEM design / symbol libraries </h1>
 <p>
  There are 2 ways to describe symbols in xschem,<br>
 </p>
 <ul>
 <li>
  first approach: define a <kbd>XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH</kbd> that is a list of paths
  to last level directories containing .sym /.sch files
 </li>
 <li>
  second approach: define a <kbd>XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH</kbd> that is a list of paths
  one or more levels above the directories containing .sym/.sch files
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  In the first approach a '<kbd>npn.sym</kbd>' symbol placed in a schematic will be
  saved as '<kbd>npn.sym</kbd>' in the .sch file, when loading back the parent
  schematic xschem will go through the elements of <kbd>XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH</kbd> and look for
  a directory containing <kbd>npn.sym</kbd>.
 </p>

 <p>
  In the second approach the '<kbd>npn.sym</kbd>' will be saved as
  '<kbd>devices/npn.sym</kbd>' (assuming <kbd>devices/</kbd> is the directory containing this
  symbol) . This is because the <kbd>XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH</kbd> is pointing to
  something like <kbd>/some/path/xschem_library/</kbd>
  and <kbd>xschem_library/</kbd> contains <kbd>devices/</kbd> (names are just given as
  examples, any dir name is allowed for <kbd>xschem_library/</kbd> and <kbd>devices/</kbd>)
 </p>

 <p>
  The first approach is preferred by pcb hobbysts, people working on
  small designs.
  the second approach is preferred for big designs where a one or more directory level
  indirection is desired for symbols, so any symbol in xschem is given
  as '<kbd>libname/symname.sym</kbd>' (one level directory specification in symbol references)
  or '<kbd>libgroup/libname/symname.sym</kbd>' (2 level directory specification in symbol references)
  instead of just '<kbd>symname.sym</kbd>'<br>
 </p>
 <p>
  In any case the real path of the symbol reference is obtained by prepending 
  the XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH paths to the symbol reference until the resulting file is found in
  the machine filesystem.
 </p>

 <p>
  For VLSI / big designs I <b>strongly</b> suggest using the second approach,
  just as an example i have the following dirs:
 </p>
 <pre class="code">
  ~/share/xschem/xschem_library/
    containing:
    devices/
    TECHLIB/
  
  ~/xschem_library/
    containing:
    stdcell_stef/
  
  ~/share/doc/xschem/
    containing:
    library_t9/
    dram/
 </pre>
  
 <p>
  then in my xschemrc i have the following:
 </p>
 <p>
  <kbd>set XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH \ <br>
  $env(HOME)/share/xschem/xschem_library:$env(HOME)/share/doc/xschem/:$env(HOME)/xschem_library</kbd><br>
 </p>
 <h3>
  You may choose either method, but please be consistent throughout your design.
 </h3>

 <h1> Change project setup runtime</h1>
 <p>
  Since Xschem now handles multiple windows or tabs, it is desirasble to load schematics from different projects
  into a single running instance of xschem.
  This is not difficult to do and you might want to write your own procedure into your xschemrc to automate this.
  Lets suppose you open a new schematic tab. After opening the new tab go to the xschem prompt in the terminal 
  you launched Xschem from, and redefine your XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH:</p>
 <pre class="code">
    set XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH {} ;# clear previous definitions
    append XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH :${XSCHEM_SHAREDIR}/xschem_library  ;# for devices/
    append XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH :/home/schippes/share/pdk/sky130A/libs.tech/xschem ;# for sky130 libs
    # project specific variables (either tcl variables or shell variables via the TCL env() array)
    set PDK_ROOT /home/schippes/share/pdk
    set PDK sky130A
    set SKYWATER_MODELS ${PDK_ROOT}/${PDK}/libs.tech/ngspice
    set SKYWATER_STDCELLS ${PDK_ROOT}/${PDK}/libs.ref/sky130_fd_sc_hd/spice
    # the following command does the necessary housekeeping to load the new paths
    set_paths
 </pre>
 <p>
  At this point your new tab will work with the new defnitions while the previous tab
  will continue with its previous settings.
 </p>
 <p class="important">
  you should create a small procedure and put int into your xschemrc so you will just need to type the 
  procedure name:
 </p><br>
 <pre class="code">
  proc set_sky130 {} {
      ## XSCHEM_SHAREDIR points to XSCHEM install path, example: /usr/local/share/xschem
      ## USER_CONF_DIR is usually ~/.xschem
      ## env may be used to set environment variables, like:
      ## set env(PDK_ROOT) .....
      global XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH XSCHEM_SHAREDIR USER_CONF_DIR env
      ## Other global TCL variables listed here depend on the project setup.
      global PDK_ROOT PDK SKYWATER_MODELS SKYWATER_STDCELLS

      # project specific variables (either tcl variables or shell variables via the TCL env() array)
      set PDK_ROOT /home/schippes/share/pdk
      set PDK sky130A
      set SKYWATER_MODELS ${PDK_ROOT}/${PDK}/libs.tech/ngspice
      set SKYWATER_STDCELLS ${PDK_ROOT}/${PDK}/libs.ref/sky130_fd_sc_hd/spice

      set XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH {} ;# clear previous definitions
      append XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH :${XSCHEM_SHAREDIR}/xschem_library  ;# for devices/
      append XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH :${PDK_ROOT}/${PDK}/libs.tech/xschem
      # the following command does the necessary housekeeping to load the new paths
      set_paths
  }
 </pre>
